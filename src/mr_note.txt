# sequential workflow: 

1. read input files, call map function, which seperate all words to (w, 1) pairs, saving in intermediate
2. sort intermediate by key
3. group all (w, 1) pairs by w, and call reduce function, which return the count of w, saving in output file

# Mapreduce wordcount in a single machine
